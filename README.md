Hi there, this project is my capstone project in  the field of Data Science in which I explored and presented the findings regarding the successful landings of the SpaceX Falcon9 Spacecaft's first phase,
which helps to predict the current mission cost so that a fictitious emerging Space company can offer a better price than SpaceX for the current mission to increase customer acquisition.
